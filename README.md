# Portland Street Trees Map

Update: As of 11/16/2022 this map will no longer have access to the backend resources that populate the map with point data. This was a student project that used a free tier of CartoDB that is unfortunately no longer freely available.

**Project:**

This map provides the user with a snapshot of the health condition of street trees for neighborhoods in Portland, Oregon. It also displays individual trees and details such as tree type, tree health condition, and the tree's common and scientific names. 

**Project Team:**  [Seth Frazier](https://sethfrazier.github.io) and [Tree Casiano](http://treecasiano.com)

**Technology Used:** Leaflet, D3, jQuery

**Data Source:** [Portland Parks and Recreation's Street Tree Inventory Project](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/53181)

_Optional instructions for those who wish to use Node to run the server locally with BrowserSync:_
